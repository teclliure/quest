Symfony Custom Standard Edition  
===============================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/teclliure/sf21Base.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/teclliure/sf21Base)

Welcome to the Symfony Standard Edition - a fully-functional Symfony2
application that you can use as the skeleton for your new applications.

I've added some Travis CI Conf Tweaks and Automated Code Reviews for use 
it as a base for my projects.
